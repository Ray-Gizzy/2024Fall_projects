Project Overview
This project aims to explore the impacts of hosting the Olympic Games on host nations, focusing on the similarities and differences between developing and developed countries. Using the 2000 Sydney Olympics (Australia) and the 2008 Beijing Olympics (China) as case studies, we analyze changes in macro-level indicators such as economic growth, infrastructure development, and tourism performance. By comparing these impacts, we seek to test our hypotheses and uncover new perspectives on how hosting the Olympics influences national development over the long term.
